Use:

```kotlin title="ListTest.kt"
val list = List(50) { index -> "Something" }
assertThat(list).hasSize(50)
```

Since **index** is unused, you could omit it:

```kotlin
val list = List(50) { "Something" }
```

Or, even using data class:

```kotlin
data class Something (
  val id: Long? = null
)

val somethings = List(3) { Something() }
```
