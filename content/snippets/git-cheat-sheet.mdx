## Global Setup

User Information Configuration for Universal Application Across Local Repositories

```bash
git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"
# set a name globally to associate your name with your Git commits
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "[valid email]"
# set an email address that will be associated with each history maker
```

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
# set automatic command line to improve the readability of Git's output by color-coding different types of information,
# such as branch names, status indicators, and more.
```

## Initializing

Initializing and cloning repositories

```bash
git init
# initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
```

```bash
git clone [url]
# retrieve repository from a hosted location via url
```

## Stage & Snapshot

Working with snapshots and Git staging area

```bash
git status
# show modified files in your working directory
```

```bash
git add [file]
# add a file to the staging area in Git
```

```bash
git reset [file]
# unstage a file from Git staging area
```

```bash
git diff
# display the differences (or "diffs") between the changes in working directory
# and the last committed version of the files in your Git repository
```

```bash
git diff --staged
# display the differences (or "diffs") between the changes that are staged (added to the Git staging area)
# and the last committed version of the files in your Git repository
```

```bash
git commit -m [descriptive message]
# create a new commit in Git with a descriptive message, this command captures the changes that are
# currently staged (added to the Git staging area) and saves them as a new commit in the Git history
```

## Branch & Merge

Isolating work in branches, and integrating changes

```bash
git branch
# show modified files in your working directory
```

```bash
git branch [branch-name]
# to create a new branch in a Git repository with the specified branch-name, or alternatively
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

```bash
git checkout
# switch to another branch and check it out into working directory
```

```bash
git merge [branch-name]
# to merge changes from one branch into another branch in Git. Specifically,
# it merges the branch specified by [branch-name] into the current branch
```

```bash
git log
# display a chronological log of commits in a Git repository
```

## Share & Update

Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repository

```bash
git remote add [alias] [url]
# add a remote repository to your Git configuration with a specified alias
```

```bash
git fetch [alias]
# fetch updates from a remote repository associated with the specified alias without merging the changes into your local branches
```

```bash
git push [remote] [branch]
# transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
```

```bash
git pull
# fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
```

## Rewrite History

Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

```bash
git rebase [branch]
# apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
```

```bash
git reset --hard [commit]
# clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
```

## Temporary Commits

Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

```bash
git stash
# temporarily save changes in your working directory that are not yet committed but that you don't want to commit at the moment
```

```bash
git stash list
# show a list of stashes that you've created in your Git repository
```

```bash
git stash pop
# apply the most recent stash in your Git repository and remove it from the stash list
```

```bash
git stash drop
# remove the most recent stash from the stash list in your Git repository
```
