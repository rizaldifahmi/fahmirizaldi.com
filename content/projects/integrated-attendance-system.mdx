## Overview

The Integrated Attendance System is a comprehensive solution for employee attendance management that connects biometric attendance machines (fingerprint & face recognition) with ADMS (Attendance Device Management System). Attendance data from the machines automatically synchronizes to the system through ADMS, which then integrates with the HR information system for efficient personnel data management.

Key development focuses:
- **Machine Integration**: Support for various attendance machines (fingerprint & face recognition)
- **ADMS**: Attendance device management system for automatic data synchronization
- **Accuracy**: Verification through biometrics (fingerprint/face)
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with HR and payroll systems
- **Security**: Protection of biometric data and employee information

## Features

### HR Dashboard
