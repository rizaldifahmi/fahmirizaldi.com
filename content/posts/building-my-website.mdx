## Get Started

As a Software Engineer, having a personal website has always been more than just a dream - it's been a necessity.
I've always wanted to create more than just a simple portfolio; I envisioned a digital sanctuary where I could showcase my professional journey, share my thoughts, and connect with like-minded individuals.
This platform would serve as my digital identity, a place where I could document my growth, share my experiences, and potentially inspire others in the tech community.

My previous attempt at creating a personal website on [rizaldifahmi.github.io](https://rizaldifahmi.github.io) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) left me wanting more.
While GitHub Pages is a fantastic platform, I found myself constrained by its limitations and complexity when it came to regular updates and maintenance.
This realization sparked my decision to embark on a fresh journey - building a new website from the ground up with modern tools and technologies that would make content management a breeze.

## Tech Stack

I used the following technology stack to build my new website:

### TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has been a game-changer in my development workflow. Its robust type system and excellent tooling support make it an invaluable asset for both frontend and backend development, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) emerged as the perfect foundation for my website. Its powerful features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and server-side rendering capabilities provide an exceptional developer experience while ensuring optimal performance for visitors.

### Authentication

I used [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication, as it provides an easy way to add authentication to your Next.js application.
With next-auth, I was able to add authentication to my website with ease, and I didn't have to worry about the complex underlying details.

### PlanetScale

I chose [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) as my database solution for its innovative approach to database management. Their serverless platform offers not just a generous free tier, but also introduces revolutionary concepts like database branching, making development and scaling a smooth experience.

### Prisma

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a collection of tools that abstract away the complex work when working with a database.
It provides features such as migrations and safe-typing, which made it a great complementary tool to work with TypeScript.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes it easy to break down styles into small reusable components.
Tailwind CSS provides a lot of useful utility classes, which made it easy for me to quickly style my website.

### Hosting

I choose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting my website, as it provides fast and secure hosting for Next.js applications.
Vercel is easy to use and provides a lot of useful features, such as automatic SSL certificates and continuous deployment.

### Vercel Analytics

I integrated my website with [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics), as it provides valuable insights into how users interact with my website.
With Vercel Analytics, I can track user behaviour, such as pageviews and bounce rates, which helps me understand what is working and what needs improvement.

### Monitoring with Sentry

Error tracking and performance monitoring are crucial for maintaining a reliable website. [Sentry](https://sentry.io) stood out as the perfect solution, offering comprehensive error tracking and performance insights that help me ensure a smooth experience for my visitors. Here's how I integrated it:

- Go to [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to register for a free tier account.
- Add Sentry integration to Vercel.
- Install package

```shell title="~"
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
```

In this case, I only want Sentry in production and I do this

```js title="next.config.js"
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs')

const SentryWebpackPluginOptions = { silent: true }

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

const nextConfig = {
  ...
}

module.exports = isDevelopment
  ? nextConfig
  : withSentryConfig(nextConfig, SentryWebpackPluginOptions)
```

## Conclusion

Creating this website has been more than just a technical project - it's been a journey of discovery and growth.
Through this process, I've not only learned new technologies but also discovered better ways to present my work and ideas.
I'm excited about the future possibilities and continued evolution of this platform.

The source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rizaldifahmi/fahmirizaldicom) for anyone interested in exploring how it's built.
I hope this article provides valuable insights for those looking to create their own digital space. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! ðŸš€
