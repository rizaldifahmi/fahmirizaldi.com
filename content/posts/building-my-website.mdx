## Get Started

Building a personal website was always a dream of mine, as a Software Engineer.
I wanted to create a platform that would serve as a one-stop-shop for all my work-related activities and personal projects.
I envisioned a place where I could showcase my skills, accomplishments, and writings in a centralised location, where I could easily keep everything up to date and in one place.
The idea behind this platform was to create a hub for my work, where people with similar interests could easily find me and my work.

In the past, I had attempted to create my personal website at [rizaldifahmi.github.io](https://rizaldifahmi.github.io), but I was not satisfied with the outcome.
I had used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build my previous website, but I found the process to be complex and time-consuming, making it difficult to update or maintain.
This is why I decided to start from scratch and build a new website that was easier to manage and maintain.
I wanted to make sure that the website was not only easy to navigate but also visually appealing.

## Tech Stack

I used the following technology stack to build my new website:

### TypeScript

I found [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to be a great language to work with, especially for a Software Engineer like myself who needs to deal with both front-end and back-end coding.

### Next.js

I choose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its simplicity and ease of use.
It provides a lot of useful features, such as automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and server-side rendering, which made it an ideal choice for building my website.

### Authentication

I used [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication, as it provides an easy way to add authentication to your Next.js application.
With next-auth, I was able to add authentication to my website with ease, and I didn't have to worry about the complex underlying details.

### PlanetScale

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a serverless database platform that is gaining popularity among hobbyists in the industry.
PlanetScale offers a generous free tier,an exciting [database branching model](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/branching), and the possibility of scaling, which makes it a great choice for building a personal website.

### Prisma

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a collection of tools that abstract away the complex work when working with a database.
It provides features such as migrations and safe-typing, which made it a great complementary tool to work with TypeScript.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes it easy to break down styles into small reusable components.
Tailwind CSS provides a lot of useful utility classes, which made it easy for me to quickly style my website.

### Hosting

I choose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting my website, as it provides fast and secure hosting for Next.js applications.
Vercel is easy to use and provides a lot of useful features, such as automatic SSL certificates and continuous deployment.

### Vercel Analytics

I integrated my website with [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics), as it provides valuable insights into how users interact with my website.
With Vercel Analytics, I can track user behaviour, such as pageviews and bounce rates, which helps me understand what is working and what needs improvement.

### Monitoring with Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform that helps developers see what actually matters, solve quicker, and learn continuously about their applications.
The steps are:

- Go to [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to register for a free tier account.
- Add Sentry integration to Vercel.
- Install package

```shell title="~"
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
```

In this case, I only want Sentry in production and I do this

```js title="next.config.js"
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs')

const SentryWebpackPluginOptions = { silent: true }

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

const nextConfig = {
  ...
}

module.exports = isDevelopment
  ? nextConfig
  : withSentryConfig(nextConfig, SentryWebpackPluginOptions)
```

## Conclusion

Building this website was a great learning experience for me, and I am proud of the outcome.
I learned a lot from other people and was able to put my own spin on the design and functionality.
I hope that future updates will be even better, with more original ideas and features.

The source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rizaldifahmi/portfolio) for anyone who wants to take a look.
I hope that this article has provided some insights and inspiration for anyone looking to build their personal website. Thank you for reading! ðŸŽ‰
